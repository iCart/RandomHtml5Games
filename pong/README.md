Made using:

- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)
- Raw javascript
- And tiny bits of jquery.

What i learned making this:

- Making simple games is easy, adding sugar (menus, controls, fun factors, etc...) is the hard part.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Custom events are good, i should use more of those.
- Using a general purpose framework (jquery) was a good idea.
- HTML5Boilerplate is a good thing, use it more.
